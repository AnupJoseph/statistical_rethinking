**Steps of drawing the Bayesian Owl**
* Theoretical Estimand
* Scientific (causal) model
* Use 1 & 2 to build the statistical model
* Simulate from 2 to validate 3 yields 1
* Analyze real data


**Bayesian Inference**
* For each possible explanation of the data
* Count all the ways data can happen
* Explanations with more ways to produce the data are plausible

**Rules of Bayesian updating**
* State a causal model for how the obsevations given arise,given each possible explanation
* Count ways data could arise for each explanation
* Relative plausibility  is relative value from (2)
